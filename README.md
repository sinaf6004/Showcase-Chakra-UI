# Mini Project explanation
Here is a mini project for learning and working with Chakra UI library in React js. I this project, we have used one of the showcases of the Chakra for not to struggle with the design issues. <br>
It has a main page that is responsive and has a navbar which can take us to the other pages of this application. When you hove on the products, you can see a card and by clicking on teh games, you can go to the /games page.<br>
In this page, we can search among the games using the search bar and we can go back to the main page by clicking on the logo. Because of the internet issues and filtering of the server endpoint of the games, I have downloaded the muck datas of that,
but there might be some issues in loading the images, because the use the filtered endpoin.
I have also used ***zustand*** for logging in and saving the user data. You can go to the /login page by clicking on the sign in menu (both options take you to the same place). In log in page, you can submit these username and passwords:
***emilys*** , ***emilyspass***. After submit, you can see the users data in the console by clicking on the blue button. Also because I wanted to show that the zustand works, so after that, you can go back to the home page and
when you arrive there, the data of the logged in user can be seen.
